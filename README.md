Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon by Tawny Andrews

This program will read data about actors and find connections between based on which movies they've acted in. This program will utilize graphs and breadth first search algorithm.

Runtime Analysis:
This program implements a breadth first search (BFS). The time complexity for BFS is O(|V| + |E|), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
